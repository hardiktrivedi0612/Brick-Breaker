# brick-breaker
Brick Breaker is an Android game that I had created as a part of my User Interface Design course at Uiversity of Texas at Dallas.
The aim of the game is that the user has to break through the series of bricks to win the game.
A ball will bounce within the screen and the user has to prevent the ball from falling down and direct the ball towards the brick.
